# Smart Garbage Collection System

The Smart Garbage Collection System is an innovative project that aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management. The system is designed to automate the garbage collection process by using sensors and IoT technology.

The system is comprised of two main components: the garbage bin and the collection vehicle. The garbage bin is equipped with sensors that detect when the bin is full. Once the bin is full, it sends a signal to the collection vehicle, which then dispatches a team to collect the garbage.

The system is designed to optimize the collection process by reducing the number of trips required to collect garbage. This not only saves time and resources but also reduces the environmental impact of waste management.

The Smart Garbage Collection System also includes a web-based dashboard that allows administrators to monitor the status of the system in real time. The dashboard provides insights into the amount of waste collected, the frequency of collections, and other important metrics.
